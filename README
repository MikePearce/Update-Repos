---- updateRepos -----
Use this script if you want to bulk checkout or bulk commit to/from a whole
bunch of repos. Very lazy and potentially dangerous. Use at your peril.

It'll also try and use phpunit to generate codecoverage for you. But that's
a bit buggy.

--- Requirments ---
Python.
svn
phpunit


---- DISCLAIMER -----
This was my FIRST ever python script, as such, it was more of a learning
excercise than anything, which is why it's closer to the "E" than the "F" on the
"AWESOMECODER" fuel guage of life (woah, what an analogy), anyway ...

---- Usage ----
Put in /usr/sbin.
Mark it as executable (chmod +x repo-update.py)
Then run it:
./repo-update --help
./repo-update up
./repo-update ci (You'll be asked for a commit message.
